              <p>art & design is my passion</p>
            </div>
            <p>Web Design is almost like an art. It is the design of various information and services over the Internet. Luckily for businesses and customers, the information and services provided are done through the World Wide Web. As earlier mentioned, Web design is a form of art, meaning that art and organization are needed to form Web pages to fit particular business needs. Web sites have now progressed into a form of advertisements for most companies.
</p>
            <p>This is where your Web design and art skills come into play. Also your knowledge of how the human eye travels across the page is very helpful meaning that you know what attracts people and makes them stop and look at your advertisement. This is why I want to pursue in visual arts to continue building upon my foundations and turn me into a professional designer. My goal is to become a web designer with a large variety of art knowledge to make my work on a professional level as well as shaping my art skills.</p>
